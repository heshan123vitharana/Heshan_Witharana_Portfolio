- **3D Profile Card**: An interactive, multi-layered profile component with depth, parallax, and floating particle effects.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: 
  - "Matrix-style" falling code streams with digital overlays.
  - Glowing orbs and geometric shapes floating in 3D space.
- **Smooth Animations**: High-performance animations powered by `framer-motion` for page transitions, scroll reveals, and micro-interactions.
- **Responsive & Mobile-First**: Fully optimized for all devices, from large desktop screens to mobile phones.
